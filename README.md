- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @nickynite
- ðŸŒ± I just finished Juno College's Web Immersive Bootcamp, prior to that I received my diploma in Computer Graphics. Iâ€™m interested in graphic design, UI/UX,      fun CSS things, and currently brushing up on my JS fundamentals.
- ðŸš² When I'm not in front of my laptop, you can find me in my garden, walking my dog or biking around Brandon, Manitoba.
- ðŸ“« you can reach me at nickynite.com
