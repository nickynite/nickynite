- 👋 <br />Hi, I’m @nickynite, my pronouns are they/ them.

- 💻 <br />I just finished Juno College's Web Development Bootcamp, prior to that I received my diploma in Computer Graphics and I also have a diploma in Media and Communications. I’m interested in graphic design, UI/UX, fun CSS things, and currently brushing up on my JS fundamentals.

- 🚲 <br />When I'm not in front of my laptop, you can find me tending to my balcony garden 🌱, walking my dog Brody 🐶&nbsp; or biking around Montreal, QC.

- 📫 <br />you can reach me at nickynite.com
