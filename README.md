- 👋 <br />Hi, I’m @nickynite
- 💻 <br />I just finished Juno College's Web Immersive Bootcamp, prior to that I received my diploma in Computer Graphics. I’m interested in graphic design, UI/UX,      fun CSS things, and currently brushing up on my JS fundamentals.
- 🚲 <br />When I'm not in front of my laptop, you can find me in my garden 👨🏻‍🌾 , walking my dog Brody 🐶&nbsp; or biking around Brandon, Manitoba.
- 📫 <br />you can reach me at nickynite.com
